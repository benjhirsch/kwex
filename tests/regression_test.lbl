By mutual agreement with PDS-SBN, FITS headers are the domain of the NH       
Project and were not part of the peer review beyond adherence to the          
FITS standard.  FITS header values, especially geometric conventions          
regarding phase angle, direction of supplied vectors and sense of light       
time and stellar aberration corrections, were chosen to serve                 
operational purposes and should be used with care.

- Keywords NEWHORIZONS:APPROX_TARGET_LINE and                                 
  NEWHORIZONS:APPROX_TARGET_SAMPLE provide the approximate pixel              
  position in the image of the center of that best guess target in            
  one-based absolute units of the PDS keywords LINES and LINE_SAMPLES,        
  respectively, as defined in the IMAGE OBJECT of this label and in the       
  PDS Standards Reference.  The origin is dependent on the definitions        
  of LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION; if those are        
  UP and RIGHT, respectively, then the origin is in the lower left.           
                                                                              
- If the best guess at the target is unknown, then all three keywords         
  will be UNK i.e. unknown. If there was no target, i.e. for some             
  instances of instrument calibration activities, the keywords will           
  be N/A.

By mutual agreement with PDS-SBN, FITS headers are the domain of the NH       
Project and were not part of the peer review beyond adherence to the          
FITS standard.  FITS header values, especially geometric conventions          
regarding phase angle, direction of supplied vectors and sense of light       
time and stellar aberration corrections, were chosen to serve                 
operational purposes and should be used with care.
